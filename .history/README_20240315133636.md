# LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models

## Introduction
- Adapting large language models to downstream tasks is useful but challenging
  - Fine-tuning is expensive and resource-intensive
  - Models like GPT-3 (175B parameters) require significant resources
- Existing parameter-efficient adaptation techniques have limitations
  - Adapter layers increase inference latency
  - Prompt-based methods reduce available sequence length
- LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models (Hu et al., 2021)
  - Efficient adaptation technique
  - Adds low-rank update matrices to pre-trained weights
  - Reduces trainable parameters while maintaining performance
- Presentation Overview
  - Explore LoRA paper in detail
  - Discuss mathematical formulation and implementation
  - Present experimental results comparing LoRA with other adaptation methods, full finetuning, freeze part of model, and LoRA adaptation.
